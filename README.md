# Easy-Featured-Images

A WordPress plugin that adds featured image adding/removing functionality to post lists. This is super-helpful because you don't need to go into single post edit pages to pages to modify your featured images.

The plugin is available in the [WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-featured-images/) and I wrote an article about how it was made on [WPMU DEV](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/easy-featured-images/). If you see any bugs please submit them here on Github, or in the plugin's [support page](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-featured-images).
