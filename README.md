# Easy Featured Images

A WordPress plugin that adds featured image adding/removing functionality to post lists. This is super-helpful because you don't need to go into single post edit pages to modify your featured images. If you'd like to learn about how this plugin was made, I wrote an article about the process on [WPMU DEV](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/easy-featured-images/).

## Description

When activated, the plugin adds an "add image" column in your admin post list. Clicking on the add image area will bring up the image selector where you can upload/select an image. Once selected, the image shows up right away and is saved.

If a post has a featured image it is shown, displaying a larger image on hover. In addition, featured image can be removed and changed, once set.

# Developer Features

Right now the plugin will add the image feature to every post type. This will clash with some special plugins which may have their own image display in the admin. You may also want to disable the functionality for posts which don't need a featured image.

You can use the `efi/post_types` filter to modify the array of post types that the plugin's functionality is assigned to. Return the final list of post types you want the plugin to be applied to:

```
add_filter( 'efi/post_types', 'my_post_type_images' );
function my_post_type_images( $post_types ) {
    unset( $post_types['page'] );
}
```
